## Downloading
Download the zip file provided in the latest release in [releases](https://github.com/SupremeCoder1707/Python-Word-Game/releases/) and unzip it. Then, open Terminal/Command Prompt and type `cd path/to/unzipped/folder` or `cd C:\path\to\unzipped\folder`. Now, type `python main.py` and the game will start! If it shows a Syntax Error, try using `python3 main.py`. 

## Why did I make this?
I just wanted to make a small, fun, python project because I did not code for about 2 months. Shout-out to my friend, [hyperf1fan](https://github.com/hyperf1fan) for giving me this idea!

### Enjoy the game!
